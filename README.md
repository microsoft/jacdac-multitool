# JACDAC Multitool

**Moved to https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac/tree/master/tools/multitool**

Usage: Drop the `.uf2` generated in [Actions](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-multitool/actions) (or from a release) on your Arcade device.

Currently only works with F4 and D5 devices (of which only F4 was tested).

## Building

Use [makecode CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/makecode) to build.

```
> npm install -g makecode
> makecode
```

If you want develop just this package, do `makecode --pxt-modules` and then `code .`.
After that, build with simply `makecode`.

If you want to develop it alongside `pxt-jacdac`, clone `pxt-jacdac` in the same folder where this repo is cloned.
Then run `makecode --pxt-modules -c mkc-arcade.json` in `pxt-jacdac` (and remove `jacdac-multitool/pxt_modules` if any).
Then create a workspace with both by running `code jacdac-multitool pxt-jacdac`.
Finally, you will need to build with `makecode --config mkc-local.json` in `jacdac-multitool`.
